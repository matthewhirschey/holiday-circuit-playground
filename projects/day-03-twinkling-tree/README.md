# Day 3: Twinkling Holiday Tree

## Overview
Transform your wooden Christmas tree into a glowing masterpiece! Today we'll add LEDs and a tactile switch to make your tree light up with festive joy. You'll learn about switches and how to create lighting patterns.

## Materials Needed
- Balsa wood tree cutout (or thick cardstock)
- Multiple LEDs (various colors)
- Tactile button switch
- Circuit Playground Express
- Copper tape
- Decorating supplies

## Instructions for Age 9

1. Prepare Your Tree:
   - Take your balsa wood tree cutout
   - Decorate it with markers or stickers
   - Plan where your LEDs will go

2. Set Up LEDs:
   - Place LEDs into the holes (or tape along edges)
   - Make sure longer legs (positive) are all on one side
   - Shorter legs (negative) should be on the other side

3. Create the Circuit:
   - Use copper tape on the back to connect positive LED legs
   - Connect negative LED legs with another strip
   - Add the tactile button switch in the middle
