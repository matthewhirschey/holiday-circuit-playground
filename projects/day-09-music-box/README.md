# Day 9: Holiday Music Box

## Overview
Today we'll create a holiday music box using the STEMMA Speaker! Building on our breadboard experience from previous days, we'll add sound to our projects. The younger group will play pre-made sounds, while the older group will program custom tunes.

## Materials Needed
- Circuit Playground Express
- STEMMA Speaker
- Mini Breadboard (from previous days)
- JST-PH to male header pin cable (comes with speaker)
- Jumper Wires (for additional connections if needed)
- USB Cable

## Instructions for Age 9

1. Understand Your STEMMA Speaker:
   - Look at the speaker
   - Notice the JST connector
   - Find the JST-to-header cable (has 3 pins):
     - Red wire (power - 3.3V)
     - Black wire (ground)
     - White wire (audio signal)

2. Set Up Breadboard:
   - Power rails (like previous days):
     - Red jumper wire from 3.3V to red (+) rail
     - Black jumper wire from GND to blue (-) rail

3. Connect Speaker:
   - Insert the 3 male header pins into breadboard:
     - Red wire to row connected to + rail
     - Black wire to row connected to - rail
     - White wire to empty row
   - Connect white wire row to A1 with jumper wire

4. Test Your Speaker:
   - Press button A for first song
   - Press button B for second song
   - Both buttons for special sounds!
   - Use switch for volume control

## Instructions for Age 13

1. Hardware Setup:
   - Follow basic connection steps
   - Ensure solid breadboard connections
   - Consider speaker placement for best sound

## Testing and Troubleshooting

### For 9-Year-Olds:
1. No Sound?
   - Check header pin connections in breadboard
   - Verify power rail connections
   - Make sure signal wire is connected
   - Try volume switch

### For 13-Year-Olds:
1. Audio Issues?
   - Test power connections
   - Verify signal routing
   - Debug code timing
   - Check audio format

## Safety Notes
- Handle speaker connections carefully
- Insert header pins straight
- Keep reasonable volume levels
- Protect speaker from damage

## Parent Notes
- Help with breadboard connections
- Guide volume control
- Assist with testing
