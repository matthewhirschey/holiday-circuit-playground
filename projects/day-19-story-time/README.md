# Day 19: Holiday Story Time

## Overview
Today we'll create a holiday story player using our STEMMA Speaker! We'll use sound generation to create tones and musical notes that tell our story. The younger group will trigger pre-made sound patterns, while the older group will program complex sound sequences.

## Materials Needed
- Circuit Playground Express
- STEMMA Speaker
- Mini Breadboard
- Alligator Clips
- Story box materials

## Optional Materials
- SD card adapter (for custom audio)
- Audio files (if using SD card)
