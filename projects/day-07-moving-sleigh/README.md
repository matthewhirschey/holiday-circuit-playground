# Day 7: Santa's Moving Sleigh

## Overview
Today we'll make Santa's sleigh move using a servo motor! Building on our breadboard skills from Day 6, we'll connect and control the servo to create motion. The younger group will create basic movements, while the older group will program complex animations.

## Materials Needed
- Circuit Playground Express
- Servo Motor
- Mini Breadboard (from Day 6)
- Jumper Wires (3 needed: power, ground, signal)
- Cardstock for sleigh cutout
- Decorating supplies

## Instructions for Age 9

1. Understand Your Servo:
   - Look at the three wires:
     - Red wire (power)
     - Brown or Black wire (ground)
     - Orange or Yellow wire (signal)
   - Notice the servo arm that will move

2. Set Up Breadboard:
   - Connect power rail:
     - Red jumper wire from 3.3V to red (+) rail
     - Black jumper wire from GND to blue (-) rail
   - Place servo wires in breadboard:
     - Red wire in row with + rail
     - Black/Brown wire in row with - rail
     - Orange/Yellow wire in empty row

3. Complete Connections:
   - Connect orange/yellow row to pin A1 using jumper wire
   - Double-check all connections
   - Make sure wires are fully inserted

4. Create Your Sleigh:
   - Cut out sleigh shape from cardstock
   - Make it light enough for servo to move
   - Attach carefully to servo arm

5. Test Your Movement:
   - Press A to move sleigh left
   - Press B to move sleigh right
   - Watch how smoothly it moves!

## Instructions for Age 13

[Rest of instructions same as before, but update any alligator clip references with jumper wires...]

## Testing and Troubleshooting

### For 9-Year-Olds:
1. Servo Not Moving?
   - Check all jumper wire connections
   - Verify power rail connections
   - Make sure wires are in correct rows
   - Try resetting the board

### For 13-Year-Olds:
1. Movement Issues?
   - Test power rail voltage if possible
   - Verify signal wire connection
   - Check servo wire placement
   - Debug with print statements

## Extensions
[Same as before...]

## Safety Notes
- Insert wires carefully and straight
- Don't force connections
- Keep servo wires organized
- Mind moving parts

## Parent Notes
- Help with breadboard setup
- Guide wire identification
- Assist with servo mounting
- Support troubleshooting

## Tips for Success
1. Wire Color Code:
   - Red wires for power (3.3V)
   - Black wires for ground
   - Different color for signal

2. Breadboard Tips:
   - Keep wires neat and organized
   - Use same row for connected items
   - Check wire insertion depth
   - Keep moving parts clear
