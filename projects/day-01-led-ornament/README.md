# Day 1: LED Holiday Ornament

## Overview
Welcome to Day 1! Today, we'll create a glowing holiday ornament using copper tape, an LED, and a coin cell battery. This project introduces the basics of circuits, showing how electricity flows through a simple path to light up an LED.

## Materials Needed
- One sheet of cardstock or thick paper
- One LED (any color)
- A coin cell battery (CR2032 or similar)
- Copper tape
- Decorating supplies (markers, stickers, glitter)
- Scissors
- String for hanging

## Instructions for Age 9

1. Gather your materials and lay them out on your workspace.

2. Draw a holiday ornament design on your cardstock:
   - It can be a snowflake, bauble, or your favorite holiday shape
   - Make it about 3-4 inches in size

3. Prepare the LED placement:
   - Decide where you want your LED to shine
   - Carefully poke two small holes through the paper for the LED legs
   - Make sure the legs stick out on the back side

4. Create the circuit:
   - Place a strip of copper tape from the positive side of the LED (longer leg) to where the battery will sit
   - Place another strip of copper tape from the negative side (shorter leg) to the opposite side of the battery location
   - Make sure the copper tape makes good contact with the LED legs

5. Add the battery:
   - Place the coin cell battery between the copper tape strips
   - Make sure the positive side touches the positive strip and negative side touches the negative strip
   - Hold it in place and watch your LED light up!

6. Complete your ornament:
   - Decorate your ornament with markers, stickers, or glitter
   - Punch a hole at the top
   - Add a string for hanging

## Instructions for Age 13

1. Follow steps 1-5 from the basic instructions.

2. Create a switch:
   - Design a paper tab that folds over the battery
   - Add copper tape to complete the circuit only when pressed
   - This creates an on/off switch for your ornament

3. Advanced circuit options:
   - Try adding multiple LEDs in parallel
   - Connect both positive legs to one copper strip
   - Connect both negative legs to another copper strip
   - Experiment with different LED colors and patterns

## Troubleshooting Tips

- If the LED doesn't light up:
  - Check LED polarity (longer leg is positive)
  - Ensure copper tape makes good contact
  - Test battery orientation
  - Check for any breaks in the copper tape

- For multiple LEDs:
  - Make sure all positive legs connect to positive strip
  - Make sure all negative legs connect to negative strip
  - Test each LED individually before connecting multiple

## Parent Notes

- This project introduces basic circuit concepts
- Emphasize proper LED polarity (longer leg is positive)
- Help with hole punching if needed
- Ensure proper battery handling
- Monitor copper tape usage and sharp edges

## Extension Activities

1. Design different ornament shapes
2. Create a pattern with multiple LEDs
3. Add a blinking circuit
4. Experiment with different switch designs
5. Try different battery positions

## Safety Notes

- Handle scissors carefully
- Don't connect battery terminals directly (short circuit)
- Adult supervision required for hole punching
- Keep small batteries away from young children
- Properly dispose of used batteries
