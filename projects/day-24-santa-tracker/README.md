# Day 24: Santa Tracker 🎅

Track Santa's journey around the world using a real-time clock and NeoPixel lights! This project combines time-keeping with festive lighting effects to create an interactive Santa tracker.

## 🎯 Project Overview
Create a magical device that tracks Santa's progress on Christmas Eve using real-time clock functionality and colorful NeoPixel displays. The project teaches concepts of time management, light programming, and interactive display creation.

## 📋 Parts Needed
- Circuit Playground Express
- Real-Time Clock (RTC) Module
- NeoPixel Jewel
- Alligator Clips
- USB Cable

## 👩‍💻 Instructions for Grace (Age 9)

### Basic Setup
1. Connect the Real-Time Clock Module:
   - Attach the RTC module to the Circuit Playground Express using alligator clips
   - Make sure all connections are secure

2. Add the NeoPixel Jewel:
   - Connect the NeoPixel Jewel to your Circuit Playground Express
   - Double-check all connections

### Programming
1. Upload the starter code (see `code/basic_tracker.py`)
2. Watch as the NeoPixel Jewel starts displaying the time
3. The lights will blink every minute to show time passing
4. As midnight approaches, the lights will get brighter

### Customization
- Try changing the colors of the lights
- Adjust how often the lights blink
- Create special patterns for different times of day

## 👨‍💻 Instructions for Henry (Age 13)

### Advanced Setup
1. Configure the RTC Module:
   - Connect the RTC to specific pins on the Circuit Playground Express
   - Initialize the clock with accurate time

2. NeoPixel Integration:
   - Wire the NeoPixel Jewel for advanced control
   - Test different brightness levels and patterns

### Programming
1. Use the advanced code template (see `code/advanced_tracker.py`)
2. Implement time zone tracking functionality
3. Create custom lighting patterns for different regions
4. Add special effects for countdown moments

### Customization Options
- Program different colors for various time zones
- Add sound effects for special moments
- Create interactive button controls

## 🛠️ Code Examples
