# Safety Guidelines

## General Safety Rules

1. Adult Supervision
   - Required for all projects
   - Must be present during component handling
   - Should review circuits before power-up

2. Workspace Safety
   - Keep workspace clean and organized
   - Use proper lighting
   - Avoid liquids near electronics
   - Have a clear work surface

3. Component Handling
   - Handle components gently
   - Avoid static electricity
   - Don't force connections
   - Keep small parts organized

## Electrical Safety

1. Battery Safety
   - Use only recommended batteries
   - Check polarity before connecting
   - Remove batteries when not in use
   - Properly dispose of used batteries
   - Keep batteries away from small children

2. Circuit Safety
   - Never short circuit batteries
   - Use appropriate voltage levels
   - Check connections before power-up
   - Turn off when not in use

3. USB Safety
   - Use proper USB cables
   - Connect/disconnect carefully
   - Don't force connections
   - Keep USB ports clean

## Tool Safety

1. Scissors
   - Use age-appropriate scissors
   - Cut away from yourself
   - Keep scissors pointed down when walking
   - Pass scissors handle-first

2. Sharp Tools
   - Adult supervision required
   - Keep tools pointed away
   - Use cutting mats
   - Store safely when not in use

## Emergency Procedures

1. In Case of Minor Injury
   - Stop activity immediately
   - Notify adult supervisor
   - Follow first aid procedures
   - Document incident

2. In Case of Electrical Issues
   - Disconnect power immediately
   - Notify adult supervisor
   - Check for damage
   - Document incident

## Best Practices

1. Before Starting
   - Review instructions
   - Gather all materials
   - Clear workspace
   - Put on safety equipment if needed

2. During Project
   - Follow instructions step by step
   - Keep workspace organized
   - Ask questions if unsure
   - Take breaks when needed

3. After Completion
   - Clean workspace
   - Store components properly
   - Document any issues
   - Review safety procedures

## Special Considerations

1. For Young Children
   - Extra supervision
   - Simplified instructions
   - More frequent breaks
   - Positive reinforcement

2. For Advanced Projects
   - Additional safety measures
   - Component-specific guidelines
   - Testing procedures
   - Documentation requirements
